# Pick-Game

This is a simple web-based dice game for two players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a score of 100 or more.

# Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser or open the live preview link. The game is designed to be played with two players.

# Gameplay

Player 1 starts the game by clicking the 'Roll Dice' button. A random dice roll is generated and the result is displayed on the screen. If the dice roll is not 1, the score is added to the current player's score. If the dice roll is 1, it's the next player's turn.

Players can choose to 'Hold' their current score, which will add the current score to their total score and switch to the next player's turn.

The game continues until one player reaches a score of 100 or more, at which point the game ends and the winning player is declared.

# Resetting the Game

To reset the game, simply click the 'New Game' button. This will reset both players' scores and the current score to 0, and the first player will roll the dice.
